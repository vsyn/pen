# Pen #

Use a web browser to (de)obfuscate a file using a text format.

Open the "pen.html" file in a web browser. The browser needs to support `ShowDirectoryPicker` and a couple of other functions only supported by Chrome based browsers at the time of publising.

Once loaded, choose the file to convert, enter a split size, 0 for no split, and choose a directory for the output.

The output will be an html file, and possibly some script files if a split size less than the size of the output is selected. When opened with a browser, this html file will prompt a reconstruction of the original chosen file in a specified location.
